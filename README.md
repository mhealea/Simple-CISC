# Simple-CISC
This is a very simplstic CISC processor design that was completed as a student projoect for a digital design course.
This is the second iteration of the design in order to convert the design from behavioral level Verilog to RTL so that I may synthesize the design using FPGA tools and implement it onto an FPGA.
