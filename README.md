# Simple-CISC
This is a very simplstic CISC processor design that was completed as a student projoect for a digital design course. The processor runs only 4x4x16 matrices, cycyles through instructions from a read only memory (ROM) and executes various mathematical operations while storing results and pulling sources from different memory locations and a stand alone register.
This is the second iteration of the design in order to convert the design from behavioral level Verilog to RTL so that I may synthesize the design using FPGA tools and implement it onto an FPGA.
